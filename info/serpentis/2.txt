SERPENTIS

•• Tongue of the Asp
Sets next gift enables his get to turn their tongues into weapons reminiscent of a snakes forked tongue. It extends in length by more than a foot, making it a viable weapon fro close-in fighting, and the more so since it becomes sharp, wickedly barbed and tainted by the vampires unholy blood. Wounds caused by the Tongue of the Asp do not heal normally.

System: No roll or blood expenditure is required, and although the power takes a full turn to activate, the character may do other things while it does so. The tongue does Strength damage in close combat, but the wounds it causes are aggravated. The player rolls Dexterity + Brawl to strike with the tongue as normal. Should the vampire inflict one or more health levels on the target, she may feed from him on the next turn as though she had bitten him with her fangs.
A strike from the Tongue of the Asp does not necessarily immobilize a foe, but the target is caught in the pleasure/pain of the Kiss as soon as the vampire begins to drink her blood.
