FORTITUDE

All vampires possess a preternatural constitution that makes most normal damage inconsequential. Fortitude bestows a resilience and vigor far beyond even normal vampiric toughness. Kindred with this power ignore the mightiest punches and barely feel hails of bullets. This Discipline also helps protect against sources of damage even vampires fear, such as sunlight, fire and terminal falls. Gangrel, Ravnos and Ventrue possess this potent ability. Gangrel enjoy the benefit of Fortitude as a matter of course, but Ravnos and especially Ventrue delight in the power's psychological effects. It's not unusual for a Ventrue to take a "fatal" blow, giving his opponent just enough time to register the vampire's smile before the Ventrue finishes off the shocked victim.

System: A character's rating in Fortitude is automatically soaked from any normal damage (bashing and lethal) that the character takes. A character with this Discipline also automatically soaks most kinds of aggravated damage, except for sunlight and fire, which are soaked only by the character's rating of Fortitude (characters without Fortitude may not soak aggravated damage). So a vampire with Fortitude 3 automatically soaks three points of aggravated from a werewolf claw, and has three dice to soak aggravated damage by sunlight or fire.
