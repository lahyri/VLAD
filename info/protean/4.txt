PROTEAN

•••• Form of the Beast
A vampire with this ability can turn himself into a wolf or a bat through the magic in his blood. Rumor has it that some Gangrel can transform themselves into quite different wild forms, but most Cainites are limited to these two forms. While wearing a different shape, the character retains his own mind and will, but his physical characteristics change, and he cannot invoke all of his Disciplines. His sense increase in acuity when he is a wolf, however, and he can fly at 25 miles per hour when he is a bat.

System: The player spends one blood point for the character to transform over three turns ((during which he can take no other actions)). At the Storyteller's discretion, the player may spend three blood points ((instead of just one)) to have the character transform in a single turn. The vampire's physical Attributes, Manipulation, Appearance and Perception change to match those of the animal's. The character also gains any attacks or special abilities ((such as flight)). The character activate only those Disciplines whose manifestations do not depend on him having human features. ((Most Thaumaturgy and Mortis powers are out, for instance)). Transforming back into the vampire's natural form costs nothing, but it takes three turns.
