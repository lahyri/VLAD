VICISSITUDE

••••• Ascendancy of the Sanguine Humor
A vampire with this power can physically transform all or part of his body into sentient vitae. This blood is identical to the vampires normal vitae in all respects. She can use it to nourish herself or others, create ghouls or establish blood oaths. If all this blood is imbibed or otherwise destroyed, the vampire meets Final Death.

System: The vampire may transform all or part of herself as she deems fit. Each leg can turn into two blood points worth of vitae, as can the torso; each arm, the head and the abdomen convert to one blood point. The blood can be reconverted to the body part, provided it is in contact with the vampire. If the blood has been utilized or destroyed, the vampire must spend a number of blood points equal to what was originally created to regrow the missing body part.
A vampire entirely in this form may not be staked, cut, bludgeoned or pierced, but he can be burned or exposed to the sun. The vampire may ooze along, drip up walls and flow through the narrowest cracks, as though she were in Tenebrous Avatar form. Mental Disciplines may be used, provided no eye contact or vocal utterance is necessary and if a vampire in this form washes over a mortal or animal, that mortal must make a Courage roll (difficulty 8) or fly into a panic.
