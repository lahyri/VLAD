VICISSITUDE

•••• Awaken the Zulo Shape
The traditional war-form of the changeable Tzimisce voivodes is the zulo shape, a hideous monstrosity a full eight feet in height with sickly greenish-grey scaled skin and powerful arms tipped with jagged black nails. A row of spines sprouts from the zulos vertebrae, and the eternal carapace exudes a foul-smelling grease.

System: The zulo shape costs two blood points to awaken. All Physical Attributes (Strength, Dexterity, Stamina) increase by three, but all Social Attributes drop to zero, save when dealing with others also in the zulo shape. However, a vampire in zulo form trying to intimidate someone may substitute Strength for a Social Attribute. Damage inflicted in brawling combat increases by one due to the jagged ridges and bony knobs creasing the creatures hands.
